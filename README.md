# Mini Message Board – Backend

The **Mini Message Board** is a simple web application that lets people share short messages in a chat-style interface.
I did this project to practice and showcase my skills in full stack JavaScript.
This is the backend, where I used Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Check out the [frontend repository](https://github.com/jurgengjoncari/mini-message-board) for the client-side code.

## Technical implementation
